# mmda - multimodal document analysis

This is work in progress...

### setup

```bash
conda create -n mmda python=3.8
```

### parsers

* [SymbolScraper](https://github.com/zanibbi/SymbolScraper/commit/bd3b04de61c7cc390d4219358ca0cd95e43aae50) - Apache 2.0

    * Quoted from README: From the main directory, issue `make`. This will run the Maven build system, download dependencies, etc., compile source files and generate .jar files in `./target`. Finally, a bash script `bin/sscraper` is generated, so that the program can be easily used in different directories.
